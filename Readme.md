# Soccer Home Advantage

## Goal
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the football/soccer season 2020/21 was very special since (nearly) all professional matches were played in **empty stadiums**. For football enthusiasts like me, this is a real bummer. However, it offers the **unique opportunity** to statistically study the influence of fans on the team performance.


## Data
### Data Description
In order to have a significant amount of data, I've collected fixtures and results from Europe's top 5 leagues (according to the [official UEFA ranking](https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2021)) in the seasons 2018/19 and 2020/21. Season 18/19 is the last one that ended before the start of the pandemic and is therefore chosen to represent a &#8216;regular&#8217; season, whereas season 20/21 lies completely in the pandemic and (almost) all matches are played without spectators.   
Note that I've excluded the last two matchdays of the English Premier League from the analysis because, at this stage, (a limited amount of) fans were allowed to enter the stadium again.

## Results
### Home Win

In the image above, you can see the percentage of all matches that were won by the **home** team, plotted for Europe's top 5 leagues in the mentioned seasons. Averaging over all five leagues yields a home win ratio of 44.8 $\pm$ 1.7%  in the pre-covid season 18/19 and 40.8% in the covid-season 20/21.  
![Away Team Victories [%]](plots//europe_away_win_percentages.png)   
The second image shows the same plot as the first one but with **away** instead of home team percentage. Equivalently, we see a lower average value in season 18/19 than 20/21 with 29.6% and 34.2%. Note that home and away team ratios are not perfectly correlated since in league football a draw is also a possible match result.
