# Soccer Home Advantage

## Goal
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the football/soccer season 2020/21 is very special since (nearly) all professional matches are played in **empty stadiums**. For football enthusiasts like me, this is a real bummer. However, it offers the **unique opportunity** to statistically study the influence of fans on the team performance.

## Data
### Data Description
In order to have a significant amount of data, I've collected fixtures and results from Europe's top 5 leagues (according to the [official UEFA ranking](https://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/uefarankings/country/#/yr/2021)). Season 2018/19 is the last one that ended before the start of the pandemic and is therefore chosen to represent a &#8216;regular&#8217; season, whereas season 2020/21 lies completely in the pandemic and (almost) all matches are played without spectators.   
Note that I've excluded the last two matchdays of the English Premier League from the analysis because, at this stage, (a limited amount of) fans were allowed to enter the stadium again.
